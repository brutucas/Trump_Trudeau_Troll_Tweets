# Trump, Trudeau, Trolls, and Fake News

This data science project involved extensive data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation to find and prepare various tweet datasets for analysis and machine-learning (ML) modelling. 

(!) Please note: I used the [Sentiment140 Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140), which is too large a file to be uploaded to GitHub.

I have performed extensive text processing and linguistic analysis to better understand the tweet text, and throughout the project I demonstrate basic and advanced NLP techniques: 
- tokenization;
- stopword removal;
- stemming and lemmatization;
- bag of words (BOW);
- TF-IDF word-weighing;
- part-of-speech tagging;
- dependency parsing;
- sentiment analysis;
- and word embeddings.

### Trump or Trudeau
The first component of this project involves tweet classification between Trump and Trudeau.

### Spotting Russian Trolls
In the second project component, I examine Russian troll tweets and train several ML models to find the most accurate classification that can distinguish between troll/not-troll tweets.

### Project Reflections
I have explored how both fake news and propaganda are easily disseminated and rapidly spread online by 'bad actors' to potentially misinform and destabilise. My skills at finding, wrangling, cleaning, analysing, and visualsing relevant data have continued to improve.

The aim of this data science project has been to provide insights into how language is used on social media, and the ease with which 'normies' and ordinary people can be fed false and/or polarising information by destabilising forces to deceive, manipulate, and misdirect.

Yet this project has also demonstrated the potential for wise deployment of artificial intelligence to identify misinformation and protect us from its poisonous effects. The project displays a machine-learning skillset with clear understanding of wise selection and training of the appropriate ML model for specific goals.
